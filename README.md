Source code of the paper titled "Compression Before Fusion: Broadcast Semantic Communication System for Heterogeneous Tasks", which is accepted to IEEE Transaction on Wireless Communication.

In the released code, we focus on the Case-II in the paper. In this case, a scenario where two different image classification tasks on CIFAR10 dataset are charged by two independent down-stream devices is considered.
